## Instructions to open exercises
### Exercise 1 - Making the Grade 
Open [Exercism link](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/making-the-grade/solutions/10331333) to view my code on the Exercism website.

OR 

Open [exercise.ipynb](https://github.com/10331333/datasci_223/blob/main/exercises/1-foundations/exercise.ipynb) to review my code. Run each code block to return the results of calling the function created in each block with an example. 


### Exercise 2 - Cleaning Data
1. Open [exercise-dirty_emnist.ipynb](https://github.com/10331333/datasci_223/blob/main/exercises/2-data-munging/exercise-dirty_emnist.ipynb) Jupyter notebook to review my code.
2. Clear outputs (if any).
3. Download this file to see required packages: [requirements.txt](https://github.com/10331333/datasci_223/blob/main/exercises/2-data-munging/requirements.txt) or follow instructions in the jupyter notebook to install and run packages.
